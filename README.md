# PWM Generator
## What is PWM?
Pulse Width Modulation is a technique of controlling the average voltage. It is a stream of voltage pulses that reduces the electric power supplied by the electrical signal. It is a square wave signal, which is represented as

This implies that PWM has only 2 outputs i.e.,
- HIGH (LOGIC 1)
- LOW (LOGIC 0)
The duty cycle of the rectangular pulse is shown as follows
